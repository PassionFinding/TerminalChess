Chess that you can play in the terminal, written in python

02/02/2022 Will be taking a hiatus from finishing this project for a while. The move functionality's been really buggy, especially for the king. For some reason int("1") isn't a valid base literaly for 10. Also will have to fix the pieces soon, since they're weird for (most) some terminals.
